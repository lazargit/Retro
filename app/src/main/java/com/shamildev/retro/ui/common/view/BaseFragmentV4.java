         *
         * onAttach
         * onCreateView
         * onViewCreated

         * Note that the onCreate (and other lifecycle events) are omitted on purpose. The
         * caveat to this approach is that views, listeners, and resources bound by
         * Butterknife will be null until onViewStatedRestored. Just be careful not to use any
         * objects bound using Butterknife before onViewStateRestored.
         *
         * Fragments that do not return a non-null View in onCreateView results in onViewCreated
         * and onViewStateRestored not being called. This means that Butterknife.bind will not get
         * called, which is completely fine because there is no View to bind. Furthermore, there is
         * no need to check if getView() returns null here because this lifecycle method only gets
         * called with a non-null View.
